==About==

This is a simple XBMC add-on which can use NVDA controler client to do text to speech on Windows using NVDA screen reader.


==Packaging==

The NVDA controler client library is not versioned so if you are going to build the plugin your-self you have to download it from http://community.nvda-project.org/wiki/Development#NVDAAPIforexternalapplicationsNVDAControllerClient
Once downloaded, extract it and put the file nvdaControllerClient32.dll into the lib folder. Then you can package the add-on.
